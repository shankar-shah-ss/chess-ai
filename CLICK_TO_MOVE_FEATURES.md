# Chess.com-Style Click-to-Move Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive click-to-move system similar to chess.com for your chess game. The system provides intuitive piece selection, move highlighting, and visual feedback.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Click-to-Move Mechanics
- **Left Click Selection**: Click on any piece of your color to select it
- **Move Execution**: Click on a valid destination square to move the selected piece
- **Piece Switching**: Click on another piece of your color to switch selection
- **Deselection**: Click on the same piece again or press ESC to deselect
- **Outside Board Clicks**: Clicking outside the board deselects the current piece

### 2. Visual Feedback System
- **Selected Piece Highlighting**: Bright yellow/green border around selected pieces
- **Move Indicators**: 
  - Semi-transparent dots for regular moves
  - Red rings around opponent pieces for capture moves
  - Subtle hover effects on all possible move squares
- **Last Move Display**: Highlighted squares with arrow showing the previous move
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**:
  - Blue tint when hovering over your own pieces
  - Green tint when hovering over valid move squares (with piece selected)
  - Red tint when hovering over invalid squares (with piece selected)

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Right-Click Preview**: Right-click any piece to temporarily preview its possible moves (2-second display)
- **Move Hint System**: Press SPACE to highlight all pieces that can move (3-second pulsing effect)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `ESC`: Deselect current piece
  - `SPACE`: Show all movable pieces
  - `Left Click`: Select/move pieces
  - `Right Click`: Preview moves

### 4. Chess.com-Style Visual Elements
- **Move Dots**: Small semi-transparent circles in the center of valid move squares
- **Capture Rings**: Colored rings around opponent pieces that can be captured
- **Move Arrows**: Arrows showing the last move made
- **Smooth Animations**: Pulsing effects for hints and previews
- **Professional Color Scheme**: Carefully chosen colors for different states

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- **Click Debouncing**: Prevents accidental double-clicks
- **Context-Sensitive Feedback**: Different visual cues based on game state
- **Intuitive Controls**: Natural click patterns similar to chess.com
- **Visual Consistency**: Coherent color scheme throughout the interface

## How to Use

### Basic Movement
1. Click on any piece of your color to select it
2. Valid moves will be highlighted with dots (empty squares) or rings (captures)
3. Click on any highlighted square to move the piece
4. The move will be executed and the piece deselected

### Advanced Features
- **Right-click** any piece to see its moves without selecting it
- **Press SPACE** to see all pieces that can move (helpful when stuck)
- **Press ESC** to deselect the current piece
- **Click outside the board** to deselect

### Visual Cues
- **Yellow border**: Currently selected piece

## Technical Implementation
