- **Comments**: Move and position comments `{like this}`
- **NAG Annotations**: Full support for Numeric Annotation Glyphs
  - `!` (good move), `?` (poor move), `!!` (brilliant), `??` (blunder)
  - `!?` (interesting), `?!` (dubious), `=` (equal), `¬±` (advantage)
- **Variations**: Alternative move sequences `(1...Nf6 2.Bc4)`
- **Extended Headers**: 25+ standard PGN headers
- **PGN Validation**: Automatic compliance checking
- **Game Statistics**: Comprehensive move and game analysis

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Game Recording
```python
from pgn_manager import PGNIntegration

# Initialize with your game
pgn = PGNIntegration(game)
pgn.start_recording()

# Moves are automatically recorded with full notation
# including disambiguation, en passant, etc.

# Save the game
pgn.save_game()
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Set player information
pgn.set_player_ratings("2800", "2750")
pgn.set_opening_classification("C42", "Petrov Defense", "Classical Attack")
pgn.set_time_control("90+30")

# Add annotations
pgn.add_move_comment("Excellent attacking move!")
pgn.add_move_annotation(1)  # Good move (!)

# Get statistics
stats = pgn.get_game_statistics()
print(f"Total moves: {stats['total_moves']}")
print(f"Captures: {stats['captures']}")

# Validate PGN
is_valid, errors = pgn.validate_current_pgn()
```
