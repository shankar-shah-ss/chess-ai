# Chess.com Style Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of chess.com-style piece selection and move highlighting in the chess-ai project.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dragger Class Transformation (`src/dragger.py`)
- **Before**: Handled drag-and-drop functionality with piece following mouse cursor
- **After**: Transformed into a piece selector with chess.com-style click-to-select behavior
- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced `dragging` with `selected` property (with backward compatibility)
  - Added `select_piece()` and `deselect_piece()` methods
  - Removed mouse-following behavior
  - Added methods to check selection state

### 2. Mouse Event Handling (`src/main.py`)
- **Before**: Click-and-drag to move pieces
- **After**: Click-to-select, click-to-move (chess.com style)
- **Key Changes**:
  - Pieces are only selected if they have valid moves
  - Removed mouse motion tracking for dragging
  - Enhanced click handling logic for piece selection and moves
  - Added visual feedback for pieces with no valid moves

### 3. Visual Enhancements (`src/game.py`)
- **Before**: Basic move highlighting during drag
- **After**: Authentic chess.com-style visual indicators
- **Key Changes**:
  - Selected piece gets yellow background highlight and thick border
  - Valid moves shown with gray dots for empty squares
  - Capture moves shown with red rings around target pieces
  - Added `show_no_moves_feedback()` for pieces without valid moves
  - Pieces remain visible on board (no hiding during selection)

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Piece Selection**: Only pieces with valid moves can be selected
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for selected pieces and valid moves
- **Error Feedback**: Red flash effect for pieces with no valid moves
- **Help System**: Updated to reflect new chess.com-style controls

## Chess.com Style Behaviors Implemented

### ✅ Piece Selection
- Click on a piece to select it
- Piece is only selected if it has valid moves
- Selected piece gets yellow highlight and border
- Valid moves are immediately shown

### ✅ Move Indicators
- **Empty squares**: Gray dots in center
- **Capture moves**: Red rings around opponent pieces
- **Selected piece**: Yellow background with thick border

### ✅ Move Execution
- Click on a highlighted valid move to execute it
- Piece is automatically deselected after move
- Invalid moves keep piece selected for retry

### ✅ Visual Feedback
- Pieces with no valid moves show red flash when clicked
- Hover effects for better user interaction
- Consistent with chess.com visual language

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintained `dragging` property as alias for `selected`
- Kept legacy method names (`drag_piece`, `undrag_piece`) for compatibility
- Existing engine and game logic remains unchanged

### Performance Optimizations
- Move calculation only happens on piece selection
- Visual feedback uses efficient pygame surfaces
- Minimal impact on game performance

### Code Structure
- Clean separation between selection logic and rendering
- Modular feedback system for easy customization
- Consistent error handling throughout

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Controls
1. **Left Click**: Select piece (if it has valid moves) or make move
2. **Right Click**: Preview piece moves temporarily
3. **ESC**: Deselect currently selected piece
4. **SPACE**: Show all pieces that can move

### Visual Indicators
- **Yellow highlight**: Selected piece
- **Gray dots**: Valid move destinations
- **Red rings**: Capture move destinations
- **Red flash**: Piece with no valid moves

## Files Modified
- `src/dragger.py`: Transformed to piece selector
- `src/main.py`: Updated mouse handling and rendering
- `src/game.py`: Enhanced visual feedback and move display

## Testing
The implementation has been tested and verified to work correctly with:
- Piece selection and deselection
- Move highlighting and execution
- Visual feedback systems
- Backward compatibility with existing features
- Engine integration and game modes

## Future Enhancements
- Sound effects for selection and invalid moves
- Animation effects for piece selection
- Customizable highlight colors
- Advanced visual feedback options
